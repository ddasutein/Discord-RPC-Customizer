**Installation:**

1. Download solution and build.

    In the Visual Studio solution, you will be presented with 2 projects:
    
    - `src/DiscordRPC.Core/Discord RPC.sln` contains the Discord RPC C# library by [Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp). *Deprecated as of version 2.3.0. Replaced with Nuget Package.*

    - `src/DiscordRPC.Main/DiscordRPC.Main.csproj` is the main starting point of the application, as well as the MainWindow.XAML file for the user interface. 

2. Create a Discord Application

    Go to [the Discord developer applications panel](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and click create a new application. After creating your application, copy the Client ID.

3. Start and Update Discord Rich Presence

    Build application then copy the **Client ID** from the Discord Application Portal and Paste in Settings > **Client ID** field in the RikoRPC app. Click "**Go online**" to initialize Discord Presence.

## Privacy Policy

*Last updated: July 22, 2019*

All right, I know most people don't bother reading Terms of Service or Privacy Policy, so I'll keep this short and simple. Because the entire source code is open source, you can see everything for yourself.

**What data does this application collect/process?**

Please note that no information from this application is sent to any third-party services except Discord and GitHub.

1. Discord Profile and Application Data

    RikoRPC will use Discord's servers to send or pull the following data:

    - Username
    
    - User avatar

    - Discord Application API data (Client ID and Rich Presence Art Assets)

    - RikoRPC application data including; Client ID, Detail, State, and Image Keys

    - [Other data transmission subject to Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discordapp.com/privacy)    

2. Processing of running applications on user's machine

    RikoRPC will scan for processes, specifically looking for the Discord Client (Stable, PTB, or Canary) and Spotify Desktop client as part of the application's functionality. This processing is done locally on the user's machine and does not send them to any third-party.

3. GitHub

    RikoRPC will access GitHub to query for a new version of this application by comparing the current application version to the latest version on GitHub.
